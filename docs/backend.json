    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support user authentication and profile management using a path-based ownership model for user data. This structure prioritizes authorization independence, clarity, and scalability.\n\n*   **Users Collection:** Stores core user information, including authentication details and references to user profiles.\n*   **UserProfiles Collection:** Stores user profile information.\n\n**Authorization Independence:**\n\nThe data structure enforces authorization independence by avoiding hierarchical authorization dependencies. Security rules rely solely on `request.auth.uid` and direct path matching. All user-related data is organized under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring that access control can be enforced based on the authenticated user's ID without needing to traverse or `get()` data from parent documents.\n\n**QAPs (Rules Are Not Filters):**\n\nThe structure supports secure `list` operations by segregating data based on ownership. Listing user profiles is not directly supported because of security concerns; this can be achieved via other means if absolutely necessary in the future.\n\n**Invariants:**\n\nThe structure supports the integrity of ownership by using path-based ownership. Each user's data is stored under their respective `/users/{userId}` path, making it straightforward to enforce ownership-based security rules."
